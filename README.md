# Music-Store---SQL-Analysis

**Project Overview :**

This project analyzes a Music Store relational database containing 11 interrelated tables (customers, employees, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, and more).

The goal was to simulate a real-world analytics scenario: answering business questions about sales, customer behavior, and music trends using SQL.

Through this project, I demonstrate proficiency in:

-  Multi-table joins
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, MAX, AVG)
- Subqueries (nested, correlated)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, ranking)
- Business-focused problem solving with SQL

**SQL Techniques Used :**

- Joins: INNER, LEFT JOINs to connect multiple tables
- Aggregations: SUM, COUNT, AVG for metrics
- Subqueries: To filter tracks by genre, identify longest tracks
- CTEs: For reusable logic, like calculating top customers per country
- Window Functions: Ranking genres by popularity within each country

**Tools Used :**
- PostgreSQL
- Dataset: Music Store (relational schema with 11 tables)
